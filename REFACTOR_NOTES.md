# AddQuestionsSection Refactor - Using saveExamWithSections API

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Atomic Operations**
- Replaced individual `addQuestionsToSection` calls with `saveExamWithSections`
- Ensures data consistency through database transactions
- Prevents partial updates that could leave the exam in an inconsistent state

### 2. **Better Data Integrity**
- The `saveExamWithSections` API handles both:
  - `ExamSectionQuestion` relationships (questions within sections)
  - `ExamQuestion` relationships (direct exam-question mapping)
- Automatically calculates section marks and total exam marks
- Maintains proper question ordering across sections

### 3. **Improved Error Handling**
- More specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- Better handling of API response errors
- Non-blocking refresh of used questions after successful operations

### 4. **Enhanced User Experience**
- Loading indicators during exam data fetching
- Clear success/error feedback
- Preserves existing exam structure while adding new questions

### 5. **Code Organization**
- Added utility function `transformSectionQuestions` for cleaner code
- Better separation of concerns
- More maintainable and readable implementation

## API Benefits

The `saveExamWithSections` API provides several advantages over individual calls:

1. **Transaction Safety**: All changes are wrapped in a database transaction
2. **Automatic Calculations**: Handles marks calculation and question counting
3. **Relationship Management**: Maintains both section-level and exam-level question relationships
4. **Validation**: Built-in validation for exam structure and question data
5. **Performance**: Single API call instead of multiple requests

## Usage Pattern

```typescript
// Old approach (multiple API calls)
await examService.addQuestionsToSection(examId, sectionId, { questionIds, marks });

// New approach (atomic operation)
await examService.saveExamWithSections(examId, {
  exam: { /* exam details */ },
  sections: [ /* complete section structure with questions */ ]
});
```

This refactor makes the question addition process more reliable and maintainable while providing better user experience.
